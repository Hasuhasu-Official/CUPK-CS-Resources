Hello,everyone.
Today,we are going to learn about great teachers
Do you know who they are?
I bet you do
They are Confucius and Socrates
1引言
Although they were born about 100 years apart,
Confucius and Socrates have constantly been put side by side,
since both of them maintain extraordinary status,
in their respective civilizations.
They have long been held up as models to inspire later generations.

2相同之处
There are several obvious similarities about Confucius and Socrates.

Both lived in the setting before schools in a formal sense
played a major role in education.

Therefore,Confucius and Socrates gathered
some respectful students around
to learn from them.

By mid-life,they had gained enough reputation for wisdom,
and neigher of them wrote down anything,
but their students preserved some of what they said

3差异:virtue and truth
In spite of the obvious similarities,
Confucius and Socrates differed
in some educational ideas

3.1孔子
Confucius placed a great emphasis on self-cultivation of Virtue
by which he meant a person should behave appropriately
according to his place in the social hierarchy

That means an emperor should behave like an emperor
a minister like a minister, a father like a father,a son like a son,and so on

Many of his interactions with his students
took the form of asking whether certain behavior
fit his requirements

The virtue, in Confucius'eyes
is always changing
since situations are always changing

But in certain situation
there is some model people can look up to and learn from

3.2苏格拉底
Different from Confucius,Socrates emphasized truth a lot

He held that  behind the ever-changing realities,
there must be something unchanging,eternal and certain

Instead of being controlled by complex realities
people should try hard to pursue the truth behind,
since truth was the only thing reliable
just as Socrates once said
"I pursue trurh like a hound."

4差异2:ways
Besides their different emphasis on virtue and truth
they also demonstrated difference in their ways
of passing in their ideas.

Now,let's read two sentences from them.

4.1孔子
"I will not enlighten my students until they have really tried hard but failed to understand.I will not instruct them until they have something to say but fail to make themselves understood."

"Thoughts should be born in the hearts of students;teachers should only act as the midwife did."

From the two sentences,we can know that
both Confucius and Socrates
thought the students should be center of teaching and learning
(student-centered)

Both of them used a lot of questions to stimulate students' thinking
and arouse their interests and initiatives to participate.

How,Confucius tried to guide the students
to reach the correct answer in his mind
so answer was very important in the case

4.2苏格拉底
By comparison,
Socrates did not emphasize answer

He used a lot of sharp questions to motivate the
students to think hard and think deeply

During the process,
the students could get closer to the truth
and get to know themselves better

5总结
So far we know that Confucius
emphasized virtue and correct answer
while Socrates emphasized the truth
for Socrates answer may not be that important

Confucius advocated people acted properly
according to their designated roles
while Socrates supported that
people should know themselves better
and approach truth as much as possible



大家好。
今天，我们将学习伟大的教师。
你知道他们是谁吗？
我打赌你知道
他们是孔子和苏格拉底
1 引言
虽然他们的出生日期相差 100 年、
孔子和苏格拉底一直被并列在一起、
因为他们在各自的文明中都保持着非凡的地位、
在各自的文明中都保持着非凡的地位。
长期以来，他们一直被奉为激励后人的楷模。

2 相同之处
孔子和苏格拉底有几个明显的相似之处。

他们都生活在学校在正式意义上的教育中发挥重要作用之前。
他们都生活在正式意义上的学校还没有在教育中发挥重要作用的时代。

因此，孔子和苏格拉底
一些尊敬的学生
向他们学习。

到了中年，他们的智慧已经赢得了足够的声誉、
但他们的学生保留了他们所说的一些话、
但他们的学生保留了他们所说的一些话。

3差异：美德与真理
尽管孔子和苏格拉底有明显的相似之处，但他们的思想却有不同之处、
孔子和苏格拉底
在某些教育思想上有所不同

3.1 孔子
孔子非常重视自我修德
他的意思是一个人应该根据自己在社会等级中的地位
根据他在社会等级中所处的地位

也就是说，帝王应该像帝王一样
大臣要像大臣，父亲要像父亲，儿子要像儿子，等等。

孔子与学生的许多互动都是询问学生的某些行为是否符合他的要求

孔子眼中的美德
是不断变化的
因为情况总是在变

但在某种情况下
有一些榜样可以让人仰望和学习

3.2 苏格拉底
与孔子不同，苏格拉底非常强调真理。

他认为，在千变万化的现实背后
一定有不变的、永恒的和确定的东西

与其被复杂的现实所控制
人们应该努力追求背后的真理、
因为真理是唯一可靠的东西
正如苏格拉底所说
"我像猎犬一样追寻真理"。

4差异2：途径
除了对美德和真理的强调不同
他们在传递思想的方式
除了对美德和真理的强调不同外，他们在传递思想的方式上也表现出了差异。

现在，让我们来读读他们的两句话。

4.1 孔子
"我不会启发我的学生，除非他们真的努力去做了，但却没有理解；我不会指导他们，除非他们有话要说，但却没有让自己理解"。

"思想应该诞生在学生的心中，教师只应充当接生婆的角色"。

从这两句话中，我们可以知道
孔子和苏格拉底
都认为教学的中心应该是学生（以学生为中心）。


孔子和苏格拉底都用大量的问题来激发学生的思考
激发学生的兴趣和参与的主动性。

但是，孔子试图引导学生
得出他心中的正确答案
因此，答案在案例中非常重要。

4.2 苏格拉底
相比之下、
苏格拉底并不强调答案

他用大量尖锐的问题激励学生勤于思考、深入思考

在这一过程中
学生可以更接近真理
并更好地认识自己

5 总结
到目前为止，我们知道孔子强调美德和正确答案
而苏格拉底强调真理
对苏格拉底来说，答案可能并不那么重要

孔子主张人们按照自己指定的角色正确行事
而苏格拉底支持人们更好地认识自己，尽可能地接近真理
